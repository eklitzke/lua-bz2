A Lua binding to Julian Seward's libbzip2.

This software is released under a BSD-style license (to be exact, the ISC
license). The full license can be found in the LICENSE file included with this
source code.

This has been tested with Lua 5.1 on Mac OS X (10.5) and Ubuntu. Getting this
to work on Windows or with an earlier version of Lua is probably just a matter
of massaging the Makefile. If this extension doesn't build for a platform
you're using and you're able to fix the Makefile, please send me your patch.
